# Bare-metal software

`uart.c` is a freestanding RV64I/Zicsr platform test linked into the 16 MiB
RAM window at `0x8000_0000`. The boot ROM transfers control there after reset.

The firmware configures the 16550-compatible UART for divisor 1, routes UART
source ID 1 through the PLIC, and arms a CLINT machine-timer deadline. UART RX
and TX are serviced only from machine external interrupts. A newline ends the
input line; carriage return immediately before it is stripped.

Given:

```text
codex\n
```

the serial output is:

```text
hello codex\n
```

If no complete line arrives within 4096 `mtime` ticks, the machine-timer ISR
cancels the deadline and the interrupt-driven UART transmits `timeout\n`.

Build the ELF and flat image with:

```sh
make sw-uart
```

Run both the successful-input and timeout boots against the integrated
platform with:

```sh
make sim-uart-firmware
```

The toolchain prefix can be overridden with `RISCV_CC` and
`RISCV_OBJCOPY`. The default is Arch Linux's `riscv64-elf-*` toolchain.
